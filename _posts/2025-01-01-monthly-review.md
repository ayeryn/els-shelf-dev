## [第七天](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18136314) (Yu Hua) - ★★

_I read in the original Chinese but English translated version available._

I believe this to be Yu Hua's newest publication at the moment and it's my first Yu Hua book. The concept is based on a Chinese afterlife belief - 头七 - regarding the "first seven days" after a person's death. The soul of the deceased is believed to return home during that time before eventually heading to the underworld.

I don't feel like getting into it too much but I just disagree with a lot in this book, including but not limited to: The very Chinese father-child relationship, characterization of a driven and ambitious woman, making peace with life.

Aside from that, the writing is nothing special and all the characters are one-dimensional. I was pretty disappointed since Yu Hua has gained a huge clout in recent years.

I still want to read his most famous piece 活着(_To Live_) though.

## [The Bat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19792871-the-bat) (Jo Nesbø) - ★★★

| Original | Translation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Polish   | English     |

I was interested in Nesbo's _The Snowman_ and thought I'd read the first of the Harry Hole series for fun. Touching on Australian Aboriginals is cool but nothing really stood out to me. Enjoyed it enough and will move to _The Snowman_.

## [Luster](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54953756-luster) (Raven Leilani) - ★★

This book explores some interesting topics(trauma, race, family). I get what Leilani is trying to do but her writing is just not for me. I find it too abstract and atmospheric; there's also too much telling and not enough showing.

The writing style really hurt the character building because it only scratches everything on the surface. It's impossible to deep dive into anyone's character because you don't have enough to go on.

## [Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63910772-everyone-in-my-family-has-killed-someone) (Benjamin Stevenson) - ★★★★☆

This is the first murder mystery read of the year! I don't have a lot of notes because this was just pure fun. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator is fantastic. This book is really funny and has some good twists and turns. The writing is not perfect but didn't take away much from my enjoyment. I'll continue to read the series.

## [四叠半神话大系](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120747171) (Tomihiko Morimi) - ★

| Original | Translation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Japanese | Chinese     |

I love time travel and AU stories hence why I picked this one up. It's just... very boring.

The main character also annoys me as he constantly blames everything on people around him and have zero agency to change. The book consists of 4 chapters and each is an AU in which MC makes a different choice for which social club to join at the beginning of college. He ends up "wasting life" in all four no matter what. Like.. what's even the point of this book?

It features mainly male characters that I don't care about. All female characters are .5-dimensional at best and suffer from sexual objectification. Essentially a book that felt like it wasn't written for me (25+ female).
